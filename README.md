# Shattered Stars Modpack
A WIP Forge modpack for Minecraft 1.19.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Minecraft 1.19 requires [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot).


### Installation
Load the [.mr file](https://github.com/Kenja-mc/shattered_stars/releases/latest) into MultiMC or GDLauncher.

Alternatively, the modpack's pack.toml is available [here](https://kenja-mc.github.io/shattered_stars/pack.toml) if you are using [packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz).

## About
The aim of this modpack is to provide a unique Minecraft experience by overhauling various aspects of the game. 
While most Minecraft modpacks already do this, you'll find that they usually fall into the same patterns. 
Whether it's Kitchen Sink, Questing, Skyblock, Expert, or some number of the above, content quality is usually dependent on the mod developers rather than the modpack developers.

We plan on breaking the mold by focusing on these key features:
 - Custom weapon and tool rebalance through Tetra datapacks
 - Custom combat overhaul through Better Combat datapacks 
 - High performance configuration
 - ...

<!-- ## Roadmap -->
<!-- ## TODO
 - [ ] Wait for other Fabric modders to update their mods to 1.18
 - [ ] Learn WorldEdit, WorldMachine, and WorldPainter to develop the map
 - [ ] Refine the dev process with packwiz, cloud services, containers, and Github Actions
 - [ ] Update [scaryzombies](https://github.com/Kenja-mc/scaryzombies) to 1.18
 - [ ] Analyze modpack performance using Java profiling tools
 - [ ] Host playtesting sessions with players of varying experience types
 - [ ] Contribute to other open source mods -->
