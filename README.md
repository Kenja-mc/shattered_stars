# Shattered Stars Modpack
A WIP Fabric modpack for Minecraft 1.18.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Minecraft 1.18+ requires [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/?variant=openjdk17&jvmVariant=hotspot).


### Installation
Load the [.zip file](https://github.com/Kenja-mc/shattered_stars/releases/latest) into MultiMC or GDLauncher.

Alternatively, the modpack's [pack.toml](https://kenja-mc.github.io/shattered_stars/pack.toml) is available here if you are using [packwiz](https://github.com/comp500/packwiz).
## About
The aim of this modpack is to provide a unique Minecraft experience by overhauling various aspects of the game. While most Minecraft modpacks already do this, you'll find that they usually fall into the same patterns. Whether it's Kitchen Sink, Questing, Skyblock, Expert, or some number of the above, very few modpacks actually try to be creative, and instead rely on mods for the content. 

We plan on breaking the mold by focusing on these key features:
 - A large, custom pre-built world
 - Custom dungeons and protected interaction zones
 - High performance configuration
 - Resource pack and shaders that actually affect gameplay
 - Replayability through custom player progression
 - custom written fabric fabric mods
 - contributions of features to open source mods
 - ...

## Roadmap
 - [ ] Wait for other Fabric modders to update their mods to 1.18
 - [ ] Learn WorldEdit, WorldMachine, and WorldPainter to develop the map
 - [ ] Refine the dev process with [Pax](https://github.com/froehlichA/pax), cloud services, containers, and Github Actions
 - [ ] Update [scaryzombies](https://github.com/Kenja-mc/scaryzombies) to 1.18
 - [ ] Analyze modpack performance using Java profiling tools
 - [ ] Host playtesting sessions with players of varying experience types
 - [ ] Contribute to other open source mods
